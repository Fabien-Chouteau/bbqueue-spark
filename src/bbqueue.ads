--  Based on James Munns' https://github.com/jamesmunns/bbqueue

--  BBqueue implements lock free, one producer one consumer, BipBuffers.
--
--  This unit only handles index offsets without having an internal buffer.
--  It can be used to allocate slices of an existing array, e.g.:
--
--     Buf : Storage_Array (8 .. 64) := (others => 0);
--     Q   : aliased Offsets_Only (Buf'Length);
--     WG  : Write_Grant := BBqueue.Empty;
--     S   : Slice_Rec;
--  begin
--     Grant (Q, WG, 8);
--     if State (WG) = Valid then
--        S := Slice (WG);
--        Buf (Buf'First + S.From .. Buf'First + S.To) := (others => 42);
--        Commit (Q, WG);
--     end if;
